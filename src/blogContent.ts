        content: `Most people in the U.S. think confusion comes from a lack of intelligence. In reality, confusion usually
comes from how information is written, not who is reading it.

Legal documents, medical explanations, technical blogs, and even workplace emails are full of long
sentences, abstract nouns, and hidden assumptions. Your brain has to decode the language before it
can understand the idea. That extra effort is called cognitive load—and it blocks learning.

The real problem isn’t hard ideas. It’s language that wasn’t written to be understood.

Baby Simple works by doing one thing extremely well: it rewrites ideas the way a patient human would
explain them to a child—without removing the meaning. Instead of giving definitions, it explains what
the thing actually does, why it matters, and how to think about it.

**Example:**
- **Complex:** “Inflation erodes purchasing power.”
- **Baby Simple:** “When prices go up, the same money buys fewer things.”

That’s not dumbing down. That’s clarity.

Baby Simple is for U.S. students who feel lost, American professionals who don’t want to fake
understanding at work, parents answering hard questions, and non‐native English speakers navigating
English‐heavy content in the United States.

Understanding shouldn’t feel like work. Baby Simple removes the friction.`

        content: `Most tools Americans use to understand things claim to help—but very few actually do.

Google gives you links and definitions, not understanding.
Dictionaries explain words, not ideas.
ChatGPT often explains more, not simpler.

The core issue is this: most tools optimize for correctness, not clarity.

A simple explanation isn’t shorter. It’s structured differently. It uses concrete examples, plain language,
and familiar concepts. It answers the question someone is afraid to ask.

Baby Simple is designed for exactly that moment—when you don’t want a lecture, you want to get it.

Instead of adding more information, Baby Simple removes what doesn’t matter and rewrites the idea in
a way your brain instantly recognizes.

If other tools give you information, Baby Simple gives you understanding.`

        content: `You might need Baby Simple if you live or work in the U.S. and:
- You reread the same sentence multiple times
- You nod in meetings but feel unsure later
- You avoid asking questions because they feel “basic”
- You struggle to explain things to kids or teammates

You probably don’t need Baby Simple if:
- You enjoy academic language
- You already deeply understand the topic
- You’re writing for experts only

Baby Simple isn’t for making things childish. It’s for making things clear enough to use.

If understanding faster would save you time, stress, or embarrassment—this tool is for you.`

        content: `After watching how people across the United States use Baby Simple, clear patterns emerge. These are the words that confuse people most:

1. **Legal language** (contracts, policies)
2. **Medical terms** (diagnoses, reports)
3. **Tech jargon** (AI, crypto, software)
4. **Academic writing**
5. **Corporate buzzwords**
6. **Parenting questions**
7. **Non‐native English confusion**

The common thread? These words are written for insiders, not humans.

Baby Simple translates insider language into everyday thinking.`

1. It removes important meaning
2. It talks down to the reader
3. It replaces words instead of explaining ideas

True simplicity keeps the idea intact while changing how it’s explained.

Baby Simple focuses on meaning first, language second. That’s why the explanations feel respectful, not
childish.`
